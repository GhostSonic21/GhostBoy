# GhostBoy

Personal project to create a DMG/CGB Emulator/Interpreter in C++. Mostly to learn about both emulation and C++.

Currently passes Blargg's CPU Instruction test. Many games play fine, and sound works.

Created in Visual Studio 2015. Requires SDL2. SDL2 Directory path defined in $(SDL2_PATH), using a property sheet named "CustomProps.props" which is defined in the gitignore.
